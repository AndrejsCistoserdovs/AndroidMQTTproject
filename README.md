# AndroidMQTTproject
My final year's project

This repository consists just of two Java files which were important for my project.
In order to run the application you need to complete following steps:

1. Clone the following repository https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java.git and import the project
 into Android Studio or Eclipse.
2. Download org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3-{VERSION}.jar and org.eclipse.paho.android.service-{VERSION}.jar libraries.
3. Add libraries to the existing project.
4. Replace the MqttCallbackHandler.java file in the imported project with MqttCallbackHandler.java from the current repository.
5. Import MessagePublisher.java file from the current repository to the project.
6. Compile the application.
7. Run the application.
8. Run the MessagePublisher.java file.
